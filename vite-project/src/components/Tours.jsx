                        <h3>The Egyptians made use of domesticated animals such as pigs, geese, sheep and goats. They
                            used almost all of the animals for eggs, meat, milk, skins, fat and horns. If an animal was
                            killed, nothing went to waste. While it was common to eat almost all animals, they don't
                            believe that they consumed pork.</h3>

                        <h3>Known as the “lungs of Africa”, the Congo Basin is the largest carbon sink in the world,
                            absorbing more carbon than the Amazon. Spanning across six countries, its rainforest
                            provides food security and an essential lifeline for indigenous and local populations and
                            serves as a critical habitat for endangered species.</h3>

                            can evolve to survive in hostile environments: plants like the acacia tree are able to
                            endure brutal heat and drought, while animals like the fennec fox have evolved huge ears to
                            hear prey.</h3>
